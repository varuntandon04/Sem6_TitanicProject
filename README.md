# Sem6_TitanicProject

This was for a project for a Data Science and Big Data Analytics course in my undergrad college. 
It focuses on the survival prediction of the Titanic disaster, based on the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**.

### The primary goal was to learn and showcase:
#### Data Handling:
* Importing Data with Pandas
* Cleaning Data
* Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

#### Data Analysis:
* Using supervised machine learning techniques

#### Valuation of the Analysis:
* K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally



Note: This project was based on Agconti's submission of the same.
